        Hitman’s Era: Redefining T20 Cricket
    </h1>
    <p>
        Rohit Sharma, fondly known as the “Hitman,” has carved a legendary place for himself in the world of T20 cricket. Ever since his debut in 2007 against England at the inaugural ICC World T20, Rohit has been one of the most consistent and stylish performers in the shortest format of the game. With his effortless stroke play, calm temperament, and ability to switch gears instantly, he has become one of the greatest T20 players the game has ever seen.

One of Rohit’s biggest strengths in T20s is his adaptability. Early in his career, he often batted in the middle order, playing the role of a stabilizer.</p>

<p>However, his true potential was unlocked when he was promoted to the top of the order. Opening the innings gave him the freedom to dictate terms from the start, and since then, he has established himself as one of the most successful openers in T20 cricket. His timing, combined with his ability to clear boundaries with minimal effort, makes him a nightmare for bowlers in the powerplay as well as at the death.

Rohit’s numbers in international T20s speak volumes about his dominance. He is the first batter in history to score five centuries in T20 internationals, a record that underlines his ability to play match-defining innings.

<p>Known for his ability to rise on big occasions, Rohit has often delivered in crucial games for India, whether it’s in World Cups or bilateral series. Along with Virat Kohli, he has been a cornerstone of India’s T20 batting unit for more than a decade.

Beyond his batting, Rohit’s leadership in T20s has also been remarkable. As captain of the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League (IPL), he transformed the franchise into one of the most successful in league history. 
Under his leadership, Mumbai won five IPL titles, a record that reflects his sharp cricketing mind, ability to stay calm under pressure, and talent for backing players at the right time. His captaincy style—composed, tactical, and player-friendly—has often been highlighted as one of the reasons for his immense success in the T20 format.

Rohit’s style of batting in T20s is not just about power hitting. While he can clear the ropes with ease, he relies equally on timing and placement, which makes his stroke play aesthetically pleasing. His signature pull shot has become iconic, often leaving fans and experts in awe. Moreover, he has the rare ability to start slow and then accelerate rapidly, turning a steady innings into an explosive one in no time.

Over the years, Rohit Sharma has also become a role model for the next generation of T20 cricketers. His career demonstrates that success in T20s is not just about brute force, but also about smart batting, temperament, and adaptability. Whether as a destructive opener, a record-breaking batsman, or a calm and tactical leader, Rohit has left an indelible mark on T20 cricket.

As his T20 journey continues, fans around the world will eagerly wait to see how many more milestones the Hitman adds to his already glittering career. For now, he stands tall as one of the greatest ambassadors of the shortest format—a true legend of T20 cricket.
