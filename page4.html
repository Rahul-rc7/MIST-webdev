    <h1>Hitman in Whites: Rohit Sharma’s Test Story</h1>
    <p>Rohit Sharma’s Test career is a story of patience, perseverance, and transformation. Unlike his instant impact in white-ball cricket, his journey in the longest format took time to settle. For years, he was seen as a limited-overs specialist, someone with immense talent but inconsistent returns in red-ball cricket. However, over the past few years, Rohit has reinvented himself, emerging as one of India’s most dependable Test openers and proving that the “Hitman” can shine just as brightly in whites.

Rohit made his Test debut in 2013, announcing his arrival in style with back-to-back centuries against West Indies.

 His effortless stroke play, elegance, and ability to dominate bowlers immediately caught attention. Yet, inconsistency and injuries hampered his progress. For a long time, he was shuffled between the middle order and the bench, never quite cementing his place in the Test XI. Critics questioned whether Rohit truly had the temperament for the grind of Test cricket.

The turning point came in 2019, when Rohit was promoted to open the innings in Test matches. It was a bold move, considering he had never opened in first-class cricket, but it turned out to be a masterstroke.

Given the new responsibility, Rohit flourished at the top of the order. His natural game, built around timing and placement, blended beautifully with the patience required for Test cricket. In his very first series as an opener against South Africa, he scored over 500 runs, including three centuries, one of which was a double hundred. Suddenly, the “white-ball giant” had transformed into a red-ball force.

What makes Rohit special in Tests is his balance between aggression and defense. While he has all the shots in the book, he has learned the art of leaving deliveries, respecting good balls, and waiting for his chance to attack. Once set, he can dominate bowlers in a way very few openers can. His pull shot, in particular, remains his trademark, executed with the same authority in whites as in colored jerseys.

Rohit has also proved himself overseas, an area where Indian openers often struggle. His century at The Oval in 2021 against England is considered one of the finest overseas knocks by an Indian opener. It wasn’t just about runs but also about discipline, resilience, and adaptability—the qualities that define great Test batsmen. That innings silenced many critics and established him as a reliable opener across conditions.

As captain of the Indian Test side, Rohit has brought calmness and clarity. His leadership is marked by tactical acumen and a steady presence, qualities that inspire confidence in the dressing room. Under him, India has continued to be a formidable force in Test cricket, both at home and abroad.

Rohit Sharma’s Test career is a testament to the power of reinvention. From struggling to find his place to becoming India’s first-choice opener and captain, he has proved his critics wrong. The “Hitman in Whites” is not just about elegance and sixes; it’s about grit, maturity, and the hunger to succeed in the toughest format of the game. His journey stands as an inspiration for cricketers who believe it’s never too late to script a legacy.</p>
