    <h1>Beyond Boundaries: Rohit Sharma and the Evolution of ODI Batting</h1>
    <p>Rohit Sharma, fondly known as the “Hitman” of Indian cricket, has built a glittering legacy in One Day Internationals (ODIs). Born on April 30, 1987, in Nagpur, he made his ODI debut against Ireland in 2007. In the initial stages of his career, Rohit struggled with inconsistency, often showing flashes of brilliance but failing to cement his place in the side. His breakthrough moment arrived in 2013 when then-captain M.S. Dhoni promoted him to open the innings. This change unlocked his full potential and completely reshaped his ODI career.

As an opener, Rohit combined elegance with destructive power. His ability to pace innings gradually and then accelerate with explosive stroke play has made him one of the most feared batsmen in the world.
</p>

<p> He is renowned for converting starts into huge scores. In fact, Rohit holds the world record for the highest individual score in ODIs: an astonishing 264 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata in 2014. He is also the only player in the world to register three double centuries in ODIs, a record that highlights both his temperament and stamina.

Rohit’s performances on big stages have been equally remarkable. During the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, he etched his name into history by scoring five centuries in a single edition — the most by any player. This extraordinary feat made him the tournament’s leading run-scorer and reaffirmed his reputation as a big-match player. His calmness under pressure and ability to rise to the occasion have often given India the edge in crucial games.
<p>

Beyond batting, Rohit has also made significant strides as a leader. He has captained India in numerous ODI matches and is admired for his calm demeanor, strategic acumen, and ability to nurture young talent. Under his leadership, India has produced consistent performances and maintained its dominance in limited-overs cricket.

Over the course of his ODI career, Rohit has amassed more than 10,000 runs, with an impressive average and strike rate. His dozens of centuries and countless match-winning knocks make him one of the greatest ODI batsmen of all time. Fans admire his effortless timing, picture-perfect pull shot, and the composure with which he anchors run chases. His legacy in ODIs is not just about numbers but also about the impact he has had on Indian cricket and world cricket at large.
